          <br>
          Ladakh and Zanskar. The Baralacha Pass is also known as "the pass with crossroads on the summit." The name, Suraj Tal, is
          <br>
          derived from 2 Hindi words; Suraj meaning Sun and Tal meaning lake. This is the reason the basin is revered as the "lake of
          <br>
          the Sun God." Legends say that a holy dip in the Suraj Tal Lake can purify one from all the sins.Suraj Tal Lake is created by
          <br>
          the streams of the Bhaga river (based on which this entire valley is known by the name Bhaga Valley today).

          It is not particularly high or difficult to cross on foot by Himalayan standards, but it has a well-deserved reputation for being dangerous

          The pass lies on the watershed between the Chenab and Beas basins. On the southern side of this pass, the Beas River emerges from underground

          and flows southward and on its northern side, the Chandra River, a source stream of the river Chenab, flows westward.
